1 Overview

This is a Hello World! Type CefSharp sample that should work with
NuGet CefSharp Version 37.0.0.

The following steps are necessary to get this to work
(Tested with Visual Studio 2013 Express):

1> Load Solution in Visual Studio
2> Enable Nuget by clicking on the Solution root via
   ContextMenu>Enable NuGet Package Restore

3> Rebuild Solution
   
4> Close and Re>Open Visual Studio (not just the solution)
   You will otherwise not see the References to CefSharp and get corresponding errors

5> Clean Solution
   Rebuild and Execute solution (should go without error)
